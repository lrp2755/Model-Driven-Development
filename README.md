# Homework #1

## Getting Started

For this first homework, a Github repository was created in order to properly 
build our the start to our Project. For this first assignment, I created the rm0-dev
branch, intitialized the Python 3 Virtual Enviornment, added requirements.txt 
which listed PyGithub, pandas, and pytest, created src/repo_miner.py which is currently
just an empty file, and finally initialized GitHub Actions CI workflow to run pytest. 

## Usage

This project will be utilized in the further development of our class project.

## Contributing

There is nothing to add in this section, this project will have contributions
throughout the semester as our class project develops. 

## License

Pandas, pytest, and PyGithub must be installed.
